Problem Statement: Smart Timetable Management System
Background
Designing a college timetable is a complex and time-consuming task due to multiple constraints. Currently, scheduling is done manually, leading to teacher clashes, classroom conflicts, and inefficient scheduling. To address this, a Smart Timetable Management System is required, offering drag-and-drop scheduling, real-time conflict detection, and customization options.

Key Features & Functionalities
1. Initial Setup: Teacher, Classroom, and Department Registration
✅ Register Teachers – Each teacher is assigned to specific subjects.
✅ Register Classrooms – Classrooms are mapped to specific Engineering Departments (CSE, IT, Civil, AI & DS, E&TC, etc.).
✅ Division Selection – While designing the timetable, the user selects which division (A, B, C, etc.) they are creating the timetable for.
✅ College Time Selection – Class teachers can define college hours (e.g., 8 AM – 3 PM or 10 AM – 5 PM) to customize the timetable design.

2. Visual Timetable Editor (Drag-and-Drop)
✅ Drag-and-Drop Scheduling – Assign teachers, subjects, and classrooms using an interactive editor.
✅ Division-Wise Timetable – Admins can design timetables separately for each division.
✅ Classroom Allocation for Engineering Departments – Ensures classrooms are assigned only to relevant departments to avoid misallocation.

3. Real-Time Conflict Detection & Resolution
✅ Teacher Clash Prevention – The system warns if a teacher is assigned to multiple classes at the same time.
✅ Classroom Conflict Detection – Prevents the same classroom from being allocated to two divisions simultaneously.
✅ Subject Time Allocation Check – Ensures subjects are scheduled correctly within the defined college hours.
✅ Color-Coded Alerts – Highlights clashes for easy resolution.

4. Teacher Substitutions (Upset Teachers Feature)
✅ If a teacher is absent, they can be marked as "Upset".
✅ The system automatically suggests available teachers as replacements.
✅ Drag-and-drop substitute teacher assignment for quick rescheduling.

5. Editing & Modification Options
✅ Teachers can edit their own schedules.
✅ Admins can override or approve changes.
✅ History log to track changes and revert if needed.

6. Multiple Viewing & Download Options
✅ Daily & Weekly Views – Users can switch between day-wise and week-wise timetables.
✅ Download Timetable in PNG, JPG, and PDF formats.
✅ Printable Versions for offline use.

7. Notifications & Alerts
✅ Automated notifications for any schedule changes.
✅ Reminders for teachers and students about upcoming lectures.
✅ Room Change & Substitution Alerts – Instant updates on lecture adjustments.

8. Advanced Analytics & Insights (Creative Additions)
✅ Teacher Workload Analysis – Tracks teaching hours for balanced distribution.
✅ Classroom Utilization Reports – Ensures classrooms are optimally used.
✅ Student Timetable Lookup – Allows students to easily check their schedules.

How It Works (Workflow)
1️⃣ Register teachers, subjects, and classrooms.
2️⃣ Select the engineering department and division (A/B/C) for timetable creation.
3️⃣ Define the college timing (e.g., 8 AM – 3 PM or 10 AM – 5 PM).
4️⃣ Use the visual drag-and-drop editor to assign lectures.
5️⃣ Resolve conflicts using real-time alerts.
6️⃣ Save and publish the timetable.
